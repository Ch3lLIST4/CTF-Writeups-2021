They gave us a git repository url so the first thing I did was cloning it. I used Github Desktop

There's a `flag.txt` file in the main branch that says `Your princess is in another castle`

I think castle here means *git branch* so I did try to take a look at all available branches on the cloned repository. I found another branch named `origin/!flag` so the flag might be there

And I was right. The flag is located in the `flag.txt` file

Flag :

```
RS{git_is_just_a_tre3_with_lots_of_branches}
```
